# TPT School Platform — Build Tracker

## Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Initialize Next.js 16 project (TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router, shadcn/ui)
- [x] Install and configure Prisma 7 with SQLite
- [x] Design full database schema (all 8 modules + behaviour/exit)
- [x] Custom credential auth system (bcrypt + session cookies, role-based guards)
- [x] Build first-run setup wizard (school name, admin account, config)
- [x] Build base layout with role-based navigation sidebar

## Phase 2: People Management
- [x] Student enrolment & profiles (guardians, medical info, documents, attendance summary)
- [x] Staff & HR management (records, roles, leave requests, approve/decline workflow)

## Phase 3: Academic
- [x] Classes (enrolment, teacher assignment, room booking)
- [x] Timetabling / scheduling (weekly grid, period management)
- [x] Attendance tracking (roll call per class, daily summary, reports)
- [x] Gradebook & assessments (grade entry, letter grades, class averages)

## Phase 4: Communication & Finance
- [x] Parent & student portal (attendance %, recent grades, outstanding fees)
- [x] Communication module (notices board, direct messaging, role/year targeting)
- [x] Finance & fees (fee types, invoicing, payment recording, status tracking)

## Phase 5: Behaviour & Wellbeing
- [x] Behaviour incident log (severity levels, parent notification, follow-up tracking)
- [x] Suspensions (in-school / out-of-school, linked to incidents)
- [x] Student exit processing (withdrawal, transfer, expulsion, graduation)
- [x] Truancy alerts (auto-flag after 3 consecutive or 10+ unexcused absences)

## Phase 6: Reports & Settings
- [x] Attendance reports (date range filter, per-student breakdown, % rates)
- [x] Grade summary reports (class/term filter, averages)
- [x] Settings (school info, academic years & terms, SMTP email config)

## Phase 7: Polish & Packaging (TODO)
- [x] Fix TypeScript compilation errors (asChild, Select.onValueChange, Prisma 7 types) — `npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean
- [x] Add Behaviour nav item to sidebar (admin + teacher)
- [x] Trigger truancy check automatically when attendance is saved
- [x] Incident detail page (`/behaviour/[id]`) — view/edit incident, add suspension
- [x] Transfer-In UI on student profile page (new tab + upsert action)
- [x] Report card PDF generation (`/api/report-card/[studentId]` + Download button on student profile + `/reports/report-cards` batch page)
- [x] Docker Compose setup for self-hosting (`tpt-school/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`, `docker-entrypoint.sh`)
- [x] Electron installer wrapper (Windows .exe / Mac .dmg) (`electron/` wrapper with `electron-builder`)
- [x] End-to-end test (setup wizard → login → all modules) (`tests/e2e/` with Playwright, 10 test files)
